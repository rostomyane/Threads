Reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given period.
In simple terms, a distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering
its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail.

Obviously, redundancy has a cost and a reliable system has to pay that to achieve such resilience for services by eliminating every single point of failure.

If a system is reliable, it is available. However, if it is available, it is not necessarily reliable.

Latecy and throughput
Number of messages globally sent by the nodes of the system regardless of the message size. 
Size of messages representing the volume of data exchanges.

 Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained.

 Load Balancer (LB) is another critical component of any distributed system. 
 It helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of services
